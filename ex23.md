Reading code:
============

Github repo: <https://github.com/rubygame/rubygame/tree/next/lib>

Notes:

- Most of the code is written someway within classes!
- Way that the whole script fits together is lots of modules all 'required' into the main script
- Can specify for a method to return nil
- <code>.collect</code> method does pretty much the same as the each method but it returns a new array

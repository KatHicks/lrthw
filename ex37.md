- You can assign a variable to the outcome of an either/or boolean expression: <code>value = block.arity == 1 ? block.call(mailbox) : block.call</code>
- Question: why would you ever want to use an alias? Isn't it just confusing having a method with two names!
- <code>.arity</code> gives an indication of the number of arguments a method requires
- Double exclamation mark <code>!!</code> is a double boolean negation so <code>!!true</code> is <code>true</code>
- You can have an <code>if</code> statement without an <code>else</code>
